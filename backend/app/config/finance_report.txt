ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before conducting analysis, evaluate and report on:

1.1 Completeness
  - Calculate missing value percentages for each variable
  - Identify patterns in missingness (random, systematic, or dependent)
  - Assess impact of missing data on analytical reliability
  - Flag if missing data exceeds 5% (moderate concern) or 15% (high concern)

1.2 Data Integrity
  - Check for duplicate records
  - Identify impossible values (e.g., negative prices, dates in future)
  - Detect extreme outliers using IQR method (values > Q3 + 3*IQR)
  - Verify data type consistency

1.3 Sample Representativeness
  - Evaluate if sample size is adequate (general rule: n ≥ 30 for normality)
  - Check for sampling bias indicators
  - Assess temporal coverage if time-series data

Report Template for Data Quality:
"Data quality assessment reveals [X%] completeness with [description of any 
issues]. [Impact statement on reliability]. [Recommendation if issues exist]."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2: UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS (VARIABLE PROFILING)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 NUMERIC VARIABLES (Continuous/Discrete)

Calculate and interpret ALL applicable statistics:

Measures of Central Tendency:
  - Mean (arithmetic average): Interpret as typical value
  - Median (50th percentile): Robust to outliers, true center
  - Mode: Most frequent value (if applicable)
  - Trimmed Mean (5% trim): Mean excluding extreme 5% on each end

Measures of Dispersion:
  - Standard Deviation: Average distance from mean
  - Variance: Squared standard deviation
  - Range: Max - Min (total spread)
  - Interquartile Range (IQR): Q3 - Q1 (middle 50% spread)
  - Coefficient of Variation (CV): (SD/Mean)*100% (relative volatility)
  - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): Average absolute distance from mean

Distribution Shape:
  - Skewness: Direction and degree of asymmetry
      * -0.5 to 0.5: Approximately symmetric
      * 0.5 to 1.0 or -1.0 to -0.5: Moderately skewed
      * > 1.0 or < -1.0: Highly skewed
  - Kurtosis: Tail heaviness and peak sharpness
      * ~3 (or 0 for excess kurtosis): Normal/Mesokurtic
      * > 3 (or > 0): Heavy tails/Leptokurtic (more outliers)
      * < 3 (or < 0): Light tails/Platykurtic (fewer outliers)

Percentile Analysis:
  - Minimum (0th percentile)
  - Q1 (25th percentile)
  - Q2/Median (50th percentile)
  - Q3 (75th percentile)
  - Maximum (100th percentile)
  - P90, P95, P99 for tail analysis

Outlier Detection:
  - Lower fence: Q1 - 1.5*IQR
  - Upper fence: Q3 + 1.5*IQR
  - Count and percentage of outliers
  - Extreme outliers: Beyond Q1 - 3*IQR or Q3 + 3*IQR

Financial Interpretation Guidelines:
  - High CV (>30%): High volatility/risk
  - Positive skew: Occasional high performers
  - Negative skew: Occasional poor performers
  - High kurtosis: Fat tails = higher extreme event risk
  - Large range vs small IQR: Dominated by outliers

Presentation Format:
| Statistic | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Mean | $X,XXX | Average value representing... |
| Median | $X,XXX | Middle value, indicating... |
| Std Dev | $XXX | Volatility of ±X%, suggesting... |
| CV | XX% | [High/Moderate/Low] relative dispersion |
| Skewness | X.XX | [Right/Left/Symmetric] distribution |
| Kurtosis | X.XX | [Heavy/Normal/Light] tails |
| IQR | $XXX | Middle 50% spans $XXX |
| Outliers | X (X%) | [Count] extreme values detected |

2.2 CATEGORICAL VARIABLES (Nominal/Ordinal)

Calculate and interpret:

Frequency Distribution:
  - Count and percentage for each category
  - Cumulative percentages for ordered categories
  - Mode (most frequent category)

Concentration Metrics:
  - Herfindahl Index (HHI): Sum of squared proportions
      * Close to 1: High concentration
      * Close to 0: High diversity
  - Entropy: -Σ(p*log(p)) - measure of uncertainty/diversity
  - Top 3 categories cumulative %

Category Analysis:
  - Dominant categories (>30% of total)
  - Minority categories (<5% of total)
  - Balanced vs imbalanced distribution

Presentation Format:
| Category | Count | Percentage | Cumulative % |
|----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| Category A | XXX | XX.X% | XX.X% |
| Category B | XXX | XX.X% | XX.X% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Insights:
- [Dominant category] represents [X%], indicating [business implication]
- Distribution is [highly concentrated/well diversified] with HHI of [X.XX]
- [Minority categories] may represent [niche segments/opportunities/risks]

      * r < -0.3: Negative correlation (interpret similarly)
  - Spearman Correlation (ρ): Monotonic relationship (rank-based)
  - Kendall's Tau (τ): Concordance measure (alternative rank correlation)
  - R-squared (r²): Proportion of variance explained

Covariance:
  - Sign: Direction of relationship (positive/negative)
  - Magnitude: Scale-dependent, use for directional insight only

Regression Insights (if applicable):
  - Slope: Change in Y per unit change in X
  - Intercept: Expected Y when X = 0
  - Residual standard error: Prediction accuracy

Visual Pattern Description:
  - Linear, exponential, logarithmic, or no clear pattern
  - Presence of clustering or subgroups
  - Outlier influence on relationship

Financial Interpretation Template:
"The (correlation_strength) (direction) correlation (r = (value), p < (sig_level)) 
between {x} and {y} suggests that (interpretation). This relationship explains 
(r_squared)% of the variance in {y}. For every unit increase in {x}, {y} 
(increases/decreases) by approximately (slope) units, which translates to 
(business_impact)."

3.2 CATEGORICAL vs NUMERIC Relationships

Group Comparison Statistics:
For each category, calculate:
  - Group mean and median
  - Group standard deviation
  - Group min/max
  - Group size (n)

Statistical Tests (mention if applicable):

Comparative Analysis:
  - Rank groups by mean performance
  - Calculate percentage difference from overall mean
  - Identify highest/lowest performers
  - Assess consistency (which group has lowest CV?)

Presentation Format:
| Group | N | Mean | Median | Std Dev | CV | Min | Max |
|-------|---|------|--------|---------|----|----|-----|
| Group A | XX | $X,XXX | $X,XXX | $XXX | XX% | $X | $X |
| Group B | XX | $X,XXX | $X,XXX | $XXX | XX% | $X | $X |

Key Differences:
- Group A outperforms Group B by (X%) on average
- Group B shows (higher/lower) volatility (CV: (X%) vs (Y%))
- Statistical significance: (statement about ANOVA results if available)

3.3 CATEGORICAL vs CATEGORICAL Relationships

Cross-Tabulation (Contingency Table):
  - Create frequency matrix of category combinations
  - Calculate row percentages, column percentages, and cell percentages
  - Identify dominant combinations

Chi-Square Test (if applicable):
  - Test independence of categories
  - Interpret strength of association (Cramér's V)

Pattern Recognition:
  - Which category combinations are overrepresented?
  - Which are underrepresented?
  - Is there a clear segmentation pattern?

3.4 TEMPORAL Relationships (Time Series)

Trend Analysis:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4: MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS (GROUP-BASED INSIGHTS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Group variable exists:

4.1 Stratified Analysis
  - Perform all bivariate analyses separately for each group
  - Compare relationships across groups
  - Identify if correlation strength varies by group

4.2 Group Performance Matrix
Create a 2x2 matrix evaluating groups on:
  - High/Low mean performance

Categorize each group:
  - High Performers with Stability
  - High Performers with Volatility
  - Low Performers with Stability
  - Low Performers with Volatility

4.3 Portfolio Composition
  - Calculate group weights (% of total)
  - Assess diversification (are groups balanced?)
  - Identify concentration risk (single group dominance)

4.4 Interaction Effects
  - Does the X-Y relationship differ by group?
  - Is there synergy or antagonism between variables and groups?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5: ADVANCED ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS

  - Avoid hedging language unless uncertainty is genuine
  - Be specific: "$45K average" not "relatively high"
  - Use financial terminology appropriately

Quantification Requirements:
  - ALWAYS include specific numbers, percentages, or ranges
  - Compare to benchmarks when possible (vs average, vs previous period)
  - Use consistent decimal places (2 for %, 0 for counts, 2-4 for stats)

Interpretation Depth:
  - Every statistic must have an interpretation
  - Every interpretation must have a business implication
  - Connect findings to real-world decisions

Visual Hierarchy:

===============================================================================
SPECIAL SCENARIOS
===============================================================================

Scenario A: Limited Correlation Data
If correlation metrics are NOT provided:
- Explicitly state: "Quantitative correlation metrics were not available in 
  the provided dataset."
- Provide qualitative assessment based on data preview patterns
- Recommend: "Further analysis with complete pairwise data would enable 
  precise correlation measurement."

Scenario B: Insufficient Sample Size
If row_count < 30:
- Add disclaimer: "Small sample size (n=(count)) limits statistical 
  reliability. Findings should be considered preliminary."
- Focus on descriptive insights rather than inferential conclusions
- Avoid significance testing

Scenario C: High Missing Data Rate
If missing data > 15%:
- Prominently flag in Data Quality section
- Assess whether missing data is random or systematic
- State impact: "Missing data rate of (X%) may bias conclusions toward 
  [direction]"

Scenario D: No Clear Relationships
If correlations are weak (|r| < 0.3):
- State clearly: "Analysis reveals weak linear relationships between variables"
- Explore alternative: "Non-linear patterns or categorical segmentation may 
  provide better insights"
- This is a valid finding - absence of correlation is informative

Scenario E: Extremely Skewed Data
If skewness > 2 or < -2:
- Recommend log transformation or rank-based methods
- Focus on median rather than mean
- Flag outlier influence
